 NYC Yellow Taxi Data Analysis Project  
Exploring Data-Driven Insights Using Azure Databricks & PySpark
 🚖 Project Highlights

- Analyzed millions of NYC taxi trips to unlock business insights!
- Hands-on big data experience:From raw CSV uploads to Cloud, to high-speed Spark computations.
- Discovered the “pulse” of NYC: Best earning vendors, busiest routes, and real-time passenger flows.

 What Was Done and Why

 Project Objective

To transform massive raw New York City Yellow Taxi data (January 2020) into actionable insights, demonstrating the power of cloud platforms and distributed data analytics.

Step-by-Step Journey

1.Cloud Storage Setup:
   - Uploaded the huge taxi CSV file to Azure Data Lake Storage—no storage headaches, instant scalability!

2. Databricks Power:
   - Launched a Spark cluster in Azure Databricks—making heavy lifting with big data quick and easy.

3. PySpark Data Wrangling:
   - Imported the data into Spark as a DataFrame for super-fast analysis.
 🚦 Key Insights Unlocked

- Created a “Revenue” Column:
  Instantly viewed total earnings per trip by combining all fare and surcharge fields.

- Uncovered NYC’s Busiest Pickup Zones:
  Ranked all city areas by where the most passengers started their journeys—perfect for targeting business opportunities.

- Compared Vendor Performance:
  Calculated and compared average fare and total earnings for each taxi company, spotlighting top performers.

- Mapped Payment Preferences:
  Broke down payment types (credit, cash, etc.) to reveal how New Yorkers (and visitors) prefer to pay.

- Identified Top Vendors on a Chosen Day:
  Pinpointed which companies made the most money and carried the most passengers on a busy day.

- Revealed Most Popular Taxi Routes:
  Found the pickup-dropoff pairs moving the greatest number of people—urban mobility in action!

- Simulated Real-Time City Heatmap: 
  Demonstrated, in a 10-second slice, which pickup locations had surges in passengers—like a city coming alive!

 🔥 What Makes This Project Special?

- Transforms “boring rows” into GOLD—business strategies, operational knowledge, and city planning material.
- Mastered state-of-the-art cloud tools: Microsoft Azure + Databricks + PySpark.
- Showcases end-to-end skills: Data ingestion, transformation, big data querying, aggregation, and insight generation—start to finish!
✨ Skills & Experience Gained

- Handling real-world, messy, big datasets with ease.
- Cloud storage management and Spark cluster setup.
- Efficient querying and aggregation on millions of records with PySpark.
- Translating raw numbers into actionable, business-friendly knowledge.

Conclusion

This project proves the value of combining modern cloud storage solutions with distributed analytics. With PySpark and Azure, massive NYC taxi data became a rich “story” of city life and business—and you learned how to tell that story, one query at a time!
